# L-Union-des-R-listes
private discord bot for L'Union des RÃ´listes

# Installation
1. You need node installed on your system, detailled instructions for different operating systems can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Check your node version with ```node -v``` . Node.js 12.0.0 or newer is required.

# Especially for Dae#5125
Delete the previous rolelist folder completly. Then go to /usr/local/src/ and clone the project. Otherwise you need to modify the path for the code below.

3. Clone the project with git. 

Go into the folder where you cloned the project. (cd....)

4. Install the packages with ```npm install```

5. Execute ```npm run install``` to create a configuration file **before** the first startup of the bot.
- ownerID : Since it's a private bot, use 263022860551847936.
- prefix : This will be the prefix for which the bot will listen (Since it's private you choose $).
- token : Token for your [application](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
6. Run the bot ```node index.js```.

## Keeping it online
-----------------------------------------
Dae wants to use systemd and systemctrl so here we go.

```js
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/rolelist.service
```
(rolelist will be the name of the service)

and copy that inside this new file

```[Unit]
Description=rolelist discord bot for unionrolistes.fr
Requires=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/src/BotRoles/index.js start
ExecStop=/usr/local/src/BotRoles/index.stop stop
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


Next step: ```sudo systemctl daemon-reload```

Then: ```sudo systemctl start rolelist```

Done.

### Useful commands
```sudo systemctl status rolelist```

Now, if you want to stop your app, the command is simply

```sudo systemctl stop rolelist```

and unsurprisingly, the following will restart things for us

```sudo systemctl restart rolelist```

If you want to make the application start up when the machine boots, you accomplish that by enabling it

```sudo systemtl enable rolelist```

and finally, if you previously enabled the app, but you change your mind and want to stop it from coming up when the machine starts, you correspondingly disable it

```sudo systemctl disable rolelist```
