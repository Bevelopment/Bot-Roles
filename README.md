### Useful commands
sudo systemctl status hello_env

Now, if you want to stop your app, the command is simply

$ sudo systemctl stop hello_env

and unsurprisingly, the following will restart things for us

$ sudo systemctl restart hello_env

If you want to make the application start up when the machine boots, you accomplish that by enabling it

$ sudo systemtl enable hello_env

and finally, if you previously enabled the app, but you change your mind and want to stop it from coming up when the machine starts, you correspondingly disable it

$ sudo systemctl disable hello_env
