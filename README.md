# L-Union-des-R-listes
private discord bot for L'Union des RÃ´listes

# Installation
1. You need node installed on your system, detailled instructions for different operating systems can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Check your node version with ```node -v``` . Node.js 12.0.0 or newer is required.

# Especially for Dae#5125
Delete the previous rolelist folder completly. Then go to /usr/local/src/ and clone the project. Otherwise you need to modify the path for the code below.

3. Clone the project with git. 
```git clone https://github.com/Myst82015/L-Union-des-R-listes rolelistbot```

Go into the folder where you cloned the project. (cd....)

4. Install the packages with ```npm install```

You will now setup the bot but before you must check some things:
 - You need a so called token for your bot.
 -> How to obtain the token? Create an [application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and follow the steps below:
 ![Bot](https://github.com/Myst82015/L-Union-des-R-listes/blob/main/assets/Screenshot_1.png)
 Now navigate to "Bot"
 ![Obtain the token](https://github.com/Myst82015/L-Union-des-R-listes/blob/main/assets/obtain_the_token%20-%20Kopie.jpg)
 And click "Copy"

5. Execute ```npm run install``` to create a configuration file **before** the first startup of the bot.
- prefix : This will be the prefix for which the bot will listen(I suggest $).
- token : Token which you obtained earlier.
- intents : **Don't touch the next options!** If you're interested why check out this ![discord post](https://blog.discord.com/the-future-of-bots-on-discord-4e6e050ab52e).
 
6. Run the bot ```node index.js```.

## Keeping it online
-----------------------------------------
Dae wants to use systemd and systemctrl so here we go.

```js
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/rolelist.service
```
(rolelist will be the name of the service)

and copy that inside this new file

```[Unit]

Requires=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/src/BotRoles/index.js start
ExecStop=/usr/local/src/BotRoles/index.stop stop
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


Next step: ```sudo systemctl daemon-reload```

Then: ```sudo systemctl start rolelist```

Done.

### Useful commands
```sudo systemctl status rolelist```

Now, if you want to stop your app, the command is simply

```sudo systemctl stop rolelist```

and unsurprisingly, the following will restart things for us

```sudo systemctl restart rolelist```

If you want to make the application start up when the machine boots, you accomplish that by enabling it

```sudo systemtl enable rolelist```

and finally, if you previously enabled the app, but you change your mind and want to stop it from coming up when the machine starts, you correspondingly disable it

```sudo systemctl disable rolelist```
